## Page was developed with HTML, CSS and JS

- This OriginSix's landpage has some features to be responsive and it's designed mobile-first.

### Mobile version:
- The landpage's header is fixed when you scroll and navigate through the page and it has a fit shadow to simulate 
a tab overlaping all the landpage
- The menu icons and page menu dynamics was developed with javascript external libraries.
- In the mobile version the page menu is hidden.
- All the sections and all the footer's icons have transition effects and emphasis effects made with CSS.

### Bigger than Mobile version:
- The landpage's header has the same effects of mobile version when you scroll the page.
- The menu icons and page menu dynamics was developed with javascript external libraries.
- In the bigger than mobile version the page menu is visible and menu emphasis which section you are. This feature was developed with JS.
- All the sections and all the footer's icons have transition effects and emphasis effects made with CSS.

Testimonials cards in the landpage was developed with JS library.

## My own challenge is:
- Change the language with button to change Portuguese to English and vice versa
- Make Dark Mode page
- Adapt the page's menu to visible menu when you use tablet.
